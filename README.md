# What is this?
I'll use this repository to program a little game.

# What game does this repository contain?
It's a game called "Ricochet Tennis". It's core mechanic is based on the famous game "PONG" developed by Atari.

# Future Plans
I am currently working on adding a starting screen with a play and settings button as well as another game mode which won't be "endless". I am also thinking about adding a Power-Up and a High Score.

I do know about some minor bugs which I'll also be working on.
