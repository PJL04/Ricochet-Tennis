It's a game called "Ricochet Tennis". It's core mechanic is based on simple Tennis. You get a point if your opponent doesn't get to the ball in time and vice versa

# Future Plans
I am currently working on adding a starting screen with a play and settings button as well as another game mode which won't be "endless". I am also thinking about adding a Power-Up and a High Score.

I do know about some minor bugs which I'll also be working on.
